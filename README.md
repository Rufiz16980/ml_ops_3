# RAG Chatbot Application

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** with the ability to switch between:
- **Ordinary Chat** ‚Äì pure LLM mode (no external context).
- **RAG Chat** ‚Äì augmented with uploaded documents for contextual answers.

The system uses **Claude 3 Haiku** as the underlying LLM.
